# Sparkify

## Introduction
This project involves manipulating large and realistic datasets with Spark to engineer relevant features for predicting churn. It uses Spark MLlib to build machine learning models with large datasets, beyond what could be done with non-distributed technologies like scikit-learn. This repository contains an analysis on a subset of this data.

## Files
`Sparkify.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook containing documented analysis. 
`mini_sparkify_event_data.json.zip` is the subset of data in compressed format.

## Requirements
```
pyspark
matplotlib
datetime
```
